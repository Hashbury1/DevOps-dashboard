## How to Explore This Project

To understand the Git branching and merging demonstrations, you can:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Hashbury1/DevOps-dashboard.git
    cd DevOps-dashboard
    ```

2.  **View the Branch History:** Use Git commands to explore the different branches created and the history of merges.
    ```bash
    git log --graph --oneline --decorate --all
    ```
    This command provides a graphical representation of the commit history, including branches and merges.

3.  **Checkout Different Branches:** Switch between the branches to see the state of the project at different stages.
    ```bash
    git checkout main        # Switch to the main branch
    git checkout feature/server-status   # Switch to the feature/server-status branch
    # ... and so on for other branches
    ```

4.  **Examine Commit Messages:** The commit messages should clearly indicate the purpose of each commit and the branching/merging actions being performed.

5.  **Observe File Changes:** Examine the content of the placeholder files in different branches to see how they evolve and how merges integrate changes.
